    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>
      These homemade choux creams are made with a light choux pastry that puffs
      up when baked. In this version, they are filled with a creme patissiere
      that's easy to make and is on top of the recipes list. You can add melted
      chocolate on top for a much better experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 recipe of cream Patissiere</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 bar melted chocolate (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil.</li>
      <li>Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand
        mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a
        couple of inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
        Centers should be dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding
        mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the creme patissiere into the
        shells.
      </li>
      <li>Dip the top of the choux cream in melted chocolate (optional)</li>
    </ol>
