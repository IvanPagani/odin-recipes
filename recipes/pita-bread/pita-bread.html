    <h2 class="title-2">Descripton</h2>
    <p>
      Pita bread is a round, leavened flat bread which is generally made with maida (plain flour), 
      but can also be made with multiple grains and whole wheat to enhance nutrition. Pita breads 
      are pale white in colour, are soft to touch and spongy.

    <h2 class="title-2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast;</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (100 degrees F / 38 degrees C);</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour;</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil;</li>
      <li>1 3/4 teaspoons salt;</li>
      <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed;</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, divided.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title-2">Directions</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Place yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and add 1 cup warm water and 1 cup flour. Whisk 
        together, then let sit until mixture bubbles and foams, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, followed by 1 1/2 cups flour. 
        Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly 
        sticky. Knead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes. 
        If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time. Turn 
        dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough around in bowl to lightly cover with oil, 
        cover bowl with foil and let rise until dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once dough has doubled, remove from bowl and place onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly pat 
        into a flat shape about 1-inch thick. Use a knife to cut dough into 8 equal pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking 
        the ends underneath the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover dough balls with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough balls to a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the tops with flour. One at 
        a time, gently pat the dough with your fingers, forming a flat, round disc about 1/4-inch thick. 
        Let the shaped dough rest for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush a cast iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat. 
        Lay one round of dough into the hot skillet; cook for 30 seconds, then flip and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. 
        Flip again and cook the first side for 1 to 2 minutes more, until both sides are golden brown. Stack 
        cooked breads on a plate, when cool enough to handle, slice breads in half and open the pocket inside 
        for stuffing.
