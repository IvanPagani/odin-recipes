    <p>
      Challah is a traditional egg bread for the Jewish Sabbath.
      It's braided and topped with poppy seeds for a beautiful presentation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title-2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F / 45 degrees C);</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast;</li>
      <li>1/2 cup honey;</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil;</li>
      <li>3 eggs, divided;</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt;</li>
      <li>8 cups unbleached all-purpose flour;</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds (optional).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title-2">Directions</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Pour warm water into a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over water. Let stand 
        until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, beating 
        after each addition until dough has pulled together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 
        about 1 1/2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half 
        and knead each half for 5 minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep it 
        from getting sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 1 1/2 inches 
        in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pinch the ends of the three snakes together firmly and braid from middle. 
        Either leave as a braid or form into a round braided loaf by bringing ends 
        together, curving the braid into a circle, and pinching ends together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease two baking trays and place the finished braid or round on each. 
        Cover with a towel and let rise for about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 
        degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid; sprinkle 
        with poppy seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire 
        rack for at least one hour before slicing.
      </li>
